## Notes

One problem that I ran into was with the tip label and total label. The numbers were being cut off with ellipses if they exceeded two digits. To fix that, I went to the main storyboard and adjusted the label box size. This was an unexpected problem for me because I assumed the number of digits did not matter/ XCode would automatically adjust font size to fit all the digits.
